# University Notes

This repo contains *most* of my notes &amp; revision material written during my undergraduate Computer Science degree at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. While the notes in this repo are my own, I would like to credit all the professors, lecturers & tutors of the respective courses at NTU.

Feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/UniversityNotes/issues) or [create a pull request](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/UniversityNotes/pulls) if you find any typos/errors!
